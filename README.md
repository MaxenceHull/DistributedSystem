# Distributed Systems: Trip reservation

# Introduction
* This project was done during the distributed system class at McGill University
* The main idea is to distibute three different services accross different servers:
  * One server manages rooms reservation
  * One server manages flights reservation
  * One server manages cars reservation
  * One server acts as a middleware
* During this project, we implemented some well-known conpcepts in distrubted systems such as
 * 2 phase commit
 * 2 phase locking 
 * Data shadowing

# Notes
* We used the Java RMI library to enable communication between servers
